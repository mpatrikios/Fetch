# input resume and Clifton Strengths from candidates from local storage into AI Context Understanding
# input job description and desired Clifton Strengths from the recruiter into AI Context Understanding
# for demonstration, we should just show one example of each and print out the results at each step
# this way we aren't waiting for external system to process 30+ documents

# this means we need to have parsed resumes and Clifton Strengths for at least 15-20 candidates in DB prior to demonstration



# Run similarity search 
# Print all candidates that match based on skills and experience

# Run ranking algorithm on Clifton strengths
# Print candidates that matched based on Clifton strengths


# Demonstrate final ranked list corresponding to job description and desired Clifton strengths
